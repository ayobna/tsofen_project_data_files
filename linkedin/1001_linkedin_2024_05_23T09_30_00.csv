"🚀 Inspiring the Next Generation in Tech! 🚀 

Yesterday, Tsofen had the pleasure of organizing a tour for 10th-grade students from Ar'ara High School's computer science track to the innovative company, Innoviz Technologies. 

The tour was an immersive experience, giving students the opportunity to engage with key figures in the tech industry. They had insightful discussions with the Deputy Chief of Development, explored automated testing with an engineer, and gained insights into lab operations from the laboratory manager. 

From mechanics to electronics and even the car garage, students got a firsthand look at how cutting-edge technology is developed and integrated. It's incredible to see young minds embracing the world of technology with such enthusiasm! 🌟

"In the ever-evolving landscape of Israel's high-tech sector, a recent Tsofen تسوفن צופן and NAS research & consulting survey unveils the nuanced impact of the conflict  on Jewish-Arab relations. Strikingly, 44% of Arab engineers express hesitancy about going to work, with over 30% reluctant to converse in Arabic. While 65% report unchanged relationships with Jewish colleagues, a significant 25% note a negative shift, emphasizing the need for proactive measures to bridge divides in this critical industry.

Tsofen's CEO, Maisam Jaljuli, urges companies to take heed, recognizing the potential ripple effect on Arab engineers' professional trajectory. As tensions persist, fostering ongoing dialogue, reinforcing human connections, and addressing the complexities arising from the security situation are paramount. The survey underscores the imperative for companies to actively cultivate #inclusivity , ensuring that all employees, regardless of background, feel valued and integral to the shared vision of a thriving high-tech ecosystem.

"Tsofen تسوفن צופן leadership speak about the unique #challenges Arab #hitech employees face in the workplace amidst the current war and the #complexity tech companies are grappling with between Jewish and Arab employees. 

🛠️ Our #research with NAS Consulting & Research indicates that while many Arab engineers feel integrated and fairly treated, they often #fear political and social discussions due to their Arab identity.

🚫 Impact of Conflict on Dialogue: Many Arab engineers sense changed attitudes towards them, experiencing isolation, microaggressions, and sometimes facing politically charged questions at work.

🤔 Navigating Social Discussions: Arab engineers often avoid discussing the conflict or related issues, fearing repercussions, highlighting the need for sensitive dialogue and mutual understanding.

🧰 Organizational Responsibility: We call on companies to foster healthy workplace environments, emphasizing #inclusion , #diversity , and #equalrights for both Jewish and Arab employees.

🤝 Creating Common Grounds: Initiatives like joint #voluntary activities among Arab and Jewish employees demonstrate efforts towards connection during challenging times.

💼 Promoting Unity Amidst Complexity: Efforts focusing on fostering #unity  among employees despite the complexities of their backgrounds and the societal challenges stemming from the conflict.

"צופן כארגון חברה אזרחית, ערבי-יהודי, תומך בשביתה נגד האדישות וההפקרה של הבטחון האישי של כולנו- בני החברה הערבית והישראלית 
גם יחד

מידע והמלצות למעסיקים בעת שביתת המחאה של החברה הערבית במחאה על  העדר פתרון וטיפול בפשיעה ובאלימות
מתחילת השנה, איבדה מדינת ישראל  167 מאזרחיה הערבים אשר היו קורבנות לאלימות המאורגנת הפוקדת את החברה הערבית. בעקבות המצב וכצעד מחאתי, הוועד הארצי של ראשי הרשויות המקומיות הערביות וועדת המעקב העליונה הכריזו על שביתה כללית של החברה הערבית שתתקיים היום, יום שלישי 05.09.2023. בין השאר החליטה הועדה גם על הקמת מטה חירום למאבק בפשיעה בחברה הערבית, קיצור יום הלימודים בבתי הספר ונקיטת פעולות חינוכיות בנושא אלימות ומחאה. השביתה תכלול את הרשויות המקומיות הערביות והגופים הקשורים אליהן, את בעלי העסקים ומערכת החינוך שתפעל עד השעה השלישית. כמו כן, תתכן הצטרפות של עובדים מהמגזר הציבורי ופעילות התנדבותית לעידוד מחאה בכניסות לישובים. 

כיצד עלולה המחאה להשפיע על הצוותים?
עובדים ועובדות ערבים עלולים להמנע  מלממש את זכותם למחות, מתוך חשש שיצטרכו להתמודד עם יחס שיפוטי או מאשים מצד עמיתים או מנהלים.ות או מהשלכות של אי הבנה הנובעת מחוסר ידע אודות המצב. כמו כן, במקומות עבודה בהם עובדים ערבים הם בייצוג נמוך מאוד, יהיה להם קשה עוד יותר לקחת חלק במחאה, שכן פעולה זו מדגישה את הזהות הנבדלת שלהם ביחס לשאר אנשי הצוות. אנשי צוות אשר אינם מזדהים עם המחאה עלולים לחוש חוסר הוגנות, תסכול משינויים ועיכובים במהלך העבודה ואף אכזבה מעמיתיהם. עם זאת, קנה המידה של האלימות והקורבנות שנפלו בשנה האחרונה מעוררים דאגה בשורות נרחבות של החברה הישראלית, ויתכן כי דווקא יהיה קל יותר ליהודים להבין את הפרספקטיבה של עמיתיהם הערבים, ומכאן לחוש יותר אמפתיה והבנה כלפי השתתפותם במחאה.  

מנהלות, מנהלים והנהלות, מה מומלץ לעשות?
*תנו לגיטימציה והביעו הבנה לרצון של עובדים לשבות. רצוי לעשות זאת ברמה האישית (ככל הניתן), בשיחה קצרה או אפילו הודעה אישית בנייד או במייל.
*גבשו החלטה לגבי הכרה או אי הכרה ביום השביתה כיום חופש. כך או כך, חשוב לתווך החלטה זו ומסרים אלו לעובדים ומנהלים בכל הדרגים באופן רשמי ושיטתי. 
*הכירו בכך שיתכן ויווצר שיבוש במהלך התקין של העבודה ביום זה. תקשרו לצוותים את המוכנות והמחויבות שלכם.ן לשאת את השיבוש לטובת מימוש הזכות למחאה או לטובת תמיכה בקידום הפתרון לבעיית האלימות.
*התייחסו לכל מקרה לגופו, והיו קשובים לעובדים השונים על מנת להבין את ההשלכות של הסיטואציה באופן ייחודי עליהם. עבור חלקם עלול להיות קושי להגיע למקום העבודה ו/או לצאת מהיישוב שלהם.
*באופן כללי, ולא רק בהקשר של השביתה, וודאו עם העובדים והעובדות הערביות כי הם חשים ביטחון במקום העבודה ועשו זאת באמצעות שיחות של מנהלים/ות ישירים ונציגי/ות מש״א עם העובדים.  
*אנו קוראים למעסיקים במגזר הפרטי להביע תמיכה במחאה ובשביתה. לתמיכה ציבורית גלויה שלכם במחאה זו יש חשיבות והשפעה רבה, הן מבחינת המסר לעובדים והעובדות בארגוניכם, יהודים וערבים כאחד, והן עבור החברה הישראלית בכללותה. אובדן השליטה, מעשי האלימות והרצח בחברה הערבית, המציאות היומיומית האלימה, מסכנים את שלום וביטחון עובדיכם ואזרחי מדינת ישראל.

Our experience at Tsofen تسوفن צופן proves it - diversity in hi-tech works!
For example: The winning team in our recent #hackathon2023 was a mixed group of Jews and Arabs. The group developed Eco Detector, an application that analyzes the #environmental #footprint of a product and encourages consumers to make wise and proper purchases while offering alternatives. When a consumer makes a purchase, they take a picture of the receipt's barcode through the app, and then receive notifications about consumption and notifications prior to the expiration date - so the consumer is reminded to  use them ahead of time!",https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7066677476550225921,Organic,,Kinneret Belzer,05/23/2023,,,All followers,1940,,,59,0.03041237,34,1,1,,0.048969071,
